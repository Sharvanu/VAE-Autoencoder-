# VAE-Autoencoder-
A Variational Autoencoder (VAE) is a generative model that learns the underlying distribution of data and can generate new samples similar to the original inputs. Unlike traditional autoencoders, VAEs learn latent representations that follow a probability distribution, enabling smooth interpolation and meaningful data generation.
